Hi, I'm Kamil! ðŸ‘‹

In my current role as a React Enginner at Bitsnap (Remote), I am at the forefront of developing and maintaining bitsnap.pl, leveraging a powerful stack including Typescript, React, Tailwind, Drizzle, Protobufs and Golang. My expertise extends to writing interfaces focused on fast, elegant and accessible user experiences. I specialize in seamlessly integrating these interfaces with backend systems, developing APIs, and implementing various integrations.

If I'm not working, I'm likely running on the Cracow, going to concerts, or hanging with friends.

Looking forward to new challenges and exciting collaborations!
